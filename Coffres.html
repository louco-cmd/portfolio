            <p class="lightLetter">In some cases, banks may need to forcibly open closed safes within their branches.
                This procedure is complex and risky due to various legal obligations. Currently, BNP Paribas relies on a
                manual process, which can lead to inefficiencies and expose the bank to compliance risks.</p>
            <p class="lightLetter">As a UX team, we were tasked with designing a solution to unify the process for safe
                break-ins and minimize the risk of procedural non-compliance through thoughtful design.</p>
