        <p class="lightLetter">The research phase focused on understanding the challenges faced by bank advisors in
            their day-to-day operations. Through interviews and observation, we mapped out key tasks that could be
            automated or supported by GARI. The experience map helped us pinpoint pain points in the workflow and
            allowed us to design a solution that would directly address these challenges, ensuring GARI provided
            tangible support for the advisors throughout their day.
