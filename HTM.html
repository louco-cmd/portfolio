            <p class="lightLetter">The Human Task Manager project was designed to improve the task distribution process
                for bank counselors. It aims to streamline the management of daily tasks by automatically assigning them
                to team members based on their availability and expertise.</p>
            <p class="lightLetter">By improving task assignment, this tool ensures that counselors can focus on
                high-priority tasks while reducing human error and inefficiencies in task allocation.</p>

                <p class="lightLetter">Within BNP Paribas’ complex organizational structure, retail bank advisors are responsible for managing a variety of tasks spanning legal, business, and personal development areas. One of the key challenges was to assign the right task to the right person at the optimal time to maximize business impact. The HTM project was initiated to address this need by developing a tool to streamline task management.</p>

                <h3 class="lightLetter">Demand and objectives</h3>
                <p class="lightLetter">
                    We were tasked with designing a new tool from scratch that would centralize all advisor tasks and improve the user experience, helping to prioritize work and enhance collaboration across bank branches. The key design objectives were:
                <ul class="lightLetter objectiveList">
                    <li>Prioritize the needs of all 7 involved entities and create a solution that covers 80% of their collective requirements.</li>
                    <li>Avoid the use of statistical displays.</li>
                    <li>Identify existing pain points in task management across the bank.</li>
