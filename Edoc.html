            <p class="lightLetter">In the context of client-bank contractual processes, banking advisors handle a large
                set of documents and supporting evidence. The existing tools for document classification and management
                do not meet user needs, leading to process circumvention and the massive storage of client documents on
                employee devices.</p>
            <p class="lightLetter">The goal was to redesign the interface and user experience of the document management
                tools (eDoc) to align with employee needs, reduce their frustrations, and improve operational
                efficiency.</p>

        <p class="lightLetter">For this project, we conducted interviews with 6 bank advisors to better understand their
            pain points and needs when managing documents. The insights gathered were mapped into an experience map,
            highlighting key challenges like inefficient document processing and navigation issues. This allowed us to
            visualize the user journey and identify critical areas for improvement.As designers, we played a crucial
            role in helping the project team prioritize development tasks using the MoSCoW method. This approach ensured
            that the most impactful features, such as batch document imports and AI-assisted verification, were
            addressed first.

            ensuring that the features we designed met their expectations.

            The feedback we gathered helped identify areas for improvement, particularly in terms of navigation and
            document verification workflows. By iterating on the design based on these insights, we ensured the final
            solution was aligned with users’ needs and improved their efficiency.</p>
